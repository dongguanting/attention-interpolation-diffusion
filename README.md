## 🌠 VIF-RAG


We broke down the VIF-RAG data synthesis process into steps and provided 10-20 samples for each step to assist with your reproduction. Be sure to replace these with your own input.

<img width="1243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d38871d3-d29d-425b-a7d5-d8a7081a110d">



### :wrench: Dependencies
General Setup Environment:
- Python 3.9
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (currently tested on version 2.1.2+cu121)
- [Transformers](http://huggingface.co/transformers/) (version 4.41.2, unlikely to work lower than this version)

```bash
cd ./VIF-RAG/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ./FollowRAG/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### :rocket: How to Perform *VIF-RAG* Data Synthesis?


Follow the interactive Jupyter notebook VIF-RAG on ``vifrag.ipynb`` to reproduce our synthesize dataset.


### 🎯 Training

We use the version of [LlaMA-Factory v0.6.3](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/releases/tag/v0.6.3). Thanks for their excellent work.

we also release our SFT version dataset as strong baseline in Table1:
- **SFT Version:** To make a fair comparison with VIF-RAG, we use the same amount of [🤗ShareGPT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/ShareGPT-12K) and [🤗RAG-QA-40K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/RAG-QA-40K) as in VIF-RAG’s data synthesis process, mixing them together to fine-tune (SFT) different baseline models.

- **VIF-RAG-QA:** We release our SFT datasets, including [🤗VIF-RAG-QA-110K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/VIF-RAG-QA-110K) and [🤗VIF-RAG-QA-20K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dongguanting/VIF-RAG-QA-20K).

### 🔑 Inference
You first need to perform inference on followRAG, and the pseudocode is as follows:
```python
followRAG_full=load_json('followRAG/followRAG_full.json')
data_inferenced=[]
for dp in followRAG_full:
    response=llm.inference(dp['prompt'])
    dp['response']=response
    data_inferenced.append(dp)
save_jsonl(data_inferenced,'results/finish_inference/data_inferenced.jsonl')
```
Please refer to the following template to prepare your result JSON files for subsequent evaluation. 
The format of each sample in your data_inferenced.jsonl should be consistent with the following form:

## 📑 Abstract

<b>TL;DR: <font color="red">AID</font> (Attention Interpolation via Diffusion)</b> is a training-free method that enables the text-to-image diffusion model to generate interpolation between different conditions with high consistency, smoothness and fidelity. Its variant, <font color="blue">PAID</font>, provides further control of the interpolation via prompt guidance.

<details><summary>CLICK for the full abstract</summary>
Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings, aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but interpolation with specific conditions like text or poses is less understood. Simple approaches, such as linear interpolation in the space of conditions, often result in images that lack consistency, smoothness, and fidelity. To that end, we introduce a novel training-free technique named Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (AID). Our key contributions include 1) proposing an inner/outer interpolated attention layer; 2) fusing the interpolated attention with self-attention to boost fidelity; and 3) applying beta distribution to selection to increase smoothness. We also present a variant, Prompt-guided Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID), that considers interpolation as a condition-dependent generative process. This method enables the creation of new images with greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency, and offers control over the exact path of interpolation. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness for conceptual and spatial interpolation.

## 📷 Application

<p align="center">
<img src="asset/applications.png">
</p>

### Compositional Generation

Given a prompt that involves multiple components (e.g., "A dog driving a car"), we use the compositional description as a guidance prompt, with each related component (e.g., "A dog" and "A car") serving as the prompts at endpoints for interpolation. Under this setting, we apply PAID and then select the image from the interpolation sequence that achieves the highest CLIP score with respect to the compositional description.

<p align="center">
<img src="asset/composition.png">
</p>

### Image Editing

We can use [P2P](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt) or [EDICT](https://github.com/salesforce/EDICT) to firstly inverse the generation process of given image, and then set the endpoint condition as the original prompt and the edting prompt, respectively, to control the editing level of images.

<p align="center">
<img src="asset/editing.png">
</p>

### Image Morphing

Using IP-Adapter, we set the two images as the condition at the endpoints of the interpolation sequence for image morphing. Notice that the text prompt can be further added to refine the generated images at the endpoints.

<p align="center">
<img src="sdxl_results/morph/1.jpg">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="sdxl_results/morph/2.jpg">
</p>

### Image-Control generation

Given a text prompt and an image, we can better control the scale of IP-Adapter by AID. To achieve this, we set one endpoint as only using text prompt as condition while the other endpoint using both text and image condition. This provides smoother control over the scale of IP-Adapter.
